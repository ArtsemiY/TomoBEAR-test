# Welcome to the tomoBEAR wiki!

TomoBEAR a software package specialized for cryo electron tomography which is written in MATLAB. With TomoBEAR you can process tomographic data acquired from an electron microscope from the raw tilt stacks to the biological structure of interest.

TomoBEAR is designed so that the user has minimal intervention and doesn't need to learn the different software packages to be able to process tomographic data from cryo EM. We tried to come up with a set of defaults which should fit many projects in the cryo ET regime. However if some parameters needs to be tweaked you are free to do so.
