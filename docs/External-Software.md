## Mandatory software

### IMOD

**Installation**

Get the IMOD of version 4.11.24 from the [IMOD download page](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html).
As well, we have tested TomoBEAR under IMOD-4.9.12 which you may find on the [IMOD package archive page](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html#Archive).

### Dynamo

**Installation**

For the non standalone version of TomoBEAR you need a Dynamo version with tilt stack alignment capabilities. The newest version can be [downloaded from here](https://wiki.dynamo.biozentrum.unibas.ch/w/index.php/Downloads).

To minimize the dependencies on different CUDA versions it is advised to recompile the CUDA kernel for averaging with the newest CUDA version which is at best already available on your machine. If not please revise the chapter CUDA on this page.

To recompile the kernel you just need to the location where dynamo was extracted and access the folder ```cuda``` inside. There you will find a file called ```makefile``` which you need to open and modify the second line containing the variable ```CUDA_ROOT=```. Please put in there the path to your most recent CUDA release available on the system.

To recompile just execute the following two commands:

* `make clean`
* `make all`

### SUSAN

**Installation**

To install and use SUSAN follow the instructions in the [SUSAN](https://github.com/rkms86/SUSAN) code repository.

**Citation**

## Optional Python-based software

### Anaconda

TomoBEAR can use various python based techniques to extend its functionality like using a neural net-based picker (crYOLO), denoising (cryoCARE) or missing wedge reconstruction algorithm (IsoNet). For that, it assumes you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed. For that either use your OS-included package manager or install it from the [Anaconda web page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). You can also take the miniconda installation to save on space and inodes.

### IsoNet

**Installation**

IsoNet is a DL framework based on convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and the U-net architecture which can be trained to both denoise and reconstruct missing wedge on cryo-elecrtron microscopy data. In order to use IsoNet under TomoBEAR, please clone the [IsoNet source code](https://github.com/IsoNet-cryoET/IsoNet) and follow the instructions on that page to setup the corresponding Python environment.

The original IsoNet version has limited missing wedge angular range of -60...+60, however there is an extended IsoNet version which allows for arbitrary parametrized missing wedge angular range on the ```mw_angle``` branch of the IsoNet original repository. TomoBEAR supports this version as well, so if you want to use it, you need to clone this branch by:
```bash
git clone --branch mw_angle https://github.com/IsoNet-cryoET/IsoNet.git IsoNet_mw
```
where ```IsoNet_mw``` is the folder name where this IsoNet version will be cloned so that original IsoNet version is not overwritten if you already got one.

### crYOLO

**Installation**

[crYOLO](https://cryolo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a DL framework based on convolutional neural nets (CNNs) which utilizes the popular **You Only Look Once (YOLO)** object detection system. crYOLO can be trained to pick particles XYZ positions from cryo-elecrtron microscopy data. If you want to try crYOLO under TomoBEAR, please follow the [crYOLO installation instructions](https://cryolo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) to setup the corresponding Python (conda) environment.
