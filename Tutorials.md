This page contains tomoBEAR tutorials which should showcase the capabilities of the processing pipeline.

# Ribosome (EMPIAR-10064)

As a first data set to showcase the capabilities of tomoBEAR we have chosen the Ribosome data set with the number 10064 i the EMPIAR database.

You can get the data set from [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10064/). In our case we used just the mixedCTEM data and achieved 11.2Ã… in resolution with ~3.5k particles. If you want you can additionally use the CTEM data to be able to pick more particles.

After downloading the data extract it in a folder of your choice. One thing one should note about this data is that

* the pixel size is not in the header
* the tilt angles are not provided



# HIV (EMPIAR-10164)

First you need to get the data set from [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10164/).
